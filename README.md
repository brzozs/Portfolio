# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience.

## About Me

As a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I'm driven to explore the intersection of technology and leadership. Beyond the classroom, I enjoy playing the piano, hitting the slopes for some skiing, and diving into the world of powersports on my quad and motorcycle. I believe in approaching every adventure, whether academic or personal, with passion and a commitment to continuous growth.
